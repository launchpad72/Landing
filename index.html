                Mount Washington, mountain in the Presidential Range, the highest (6,288 feet [1,917 metres])
                peak of the White Mountains, New Hampshire, U.S. The peak is 23 miles (37 km) north-northwest of
                Conway.The
                mountain is notorious for its erratic weather. On the afternoon of April 12, 1934, the Mount Washington
                Observatory recorded a windspeed of 231 miles per hour (372 km/h) at the summit, the world record from
                1934
                until 1996. Mount Washington still holds the record for highest measured wind speed not associated with
                a
                tornado or tropical cyclone

                The treeless summit, the state’s highest point, is accessible by road from Pinkham Notch, by a
                cog railway (1869) northeast of Crawford Notch, and by marked hiking trails. Summit buildings, anchored
                against high winds, include Tip Top House and Summit House, open to the public in summer, and Mount
                Washington Weather Observatory. The area is included in the White Mountain National Forest. Mount
                Washington
                is the watershed of the Androscoggin, Connecticut, and Saco rivers.

                East of the summit, a plateau known as the Alpine Gardens extends south from Chandler Ridge at
                about 5,200 feet (1,600 m) elevation. It is notable for plant species either endemic to alpine meadows
                in
                the White Mountains or outliers of larger populations in arctic regions far to the north.[33] Alpine
                Gardens
                drops off precipitously into two prominent glacial cirques. Craggy Huntington Ravine offers rock and ice
                climbing in an alpine setting. More rounded Tuckerman Ravine is New England's premier venue for spring
                back-country skiing as late as June and then a scenic hiking route.

                Although the western slope that the Cog Railway ascends is straightforward from base to summit,
                the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest
                glacial
                cirque—forms an amphitheater surrounded by the Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and
                Madison.[14] These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge
                extends
                northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is
                ascended
                by the Mount Washington Auto Road.

                South of the summit lies a second and larger alpine plateau, Bigelow Lawn,[35] at 5,000 feet
                (1,500 m) to 5,500 feet (1,700 m) elevation. Satellite summit Boott Spur and then the Montalban Ridge
                including Mount Isolation and Mount Davis extend south from it, while the higher Southern
                Presidentials—Mounts Monroe, Franklin, Eisenhower, Pierce, Jackson and Webster—extend southwest to
                Crawford
                Notch. Oakes Gulf separates the two high ridges.
